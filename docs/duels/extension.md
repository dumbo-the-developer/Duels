#### Vault (economy)

Use Vault if you pay out money rewards.

1. Install Vault.
2. Install an economy provider (EssentialsX, CMI, etc).
3. Restart the server.

#### PlaceholderAPI

Install PlaceholderAPI if you want placeholders for scoreboards, chat, or GUIs.

1. Install PlaceholderAPI.

### Custom add-ons

Common extension points:

* Run commands on win/loss.

If you have a public Java API, document it in [Developer API](developer-api.md). If not, keep that page as a “coming soon” stub.
